# Project Title: 01.02 HelloWorld
### Purpose: Introducing Myself to Java [Again]
### Version: 1.0.0 - Date: 8/14/2025
### Authors: SaxbyMod

## About the Project:
### Comparing Java to C#
Most of Java is similar to C# just with some slight changes such as seperation of System into sub modules such as the writing part with `Out/In`. Syntax is also almost Identical outside of the If Check system.
### What was this project made for?
Just a lesson in my AP Computer Science; Advanced class. Why this was posted to GitHub [if it was] is likely because I wanted to keep the code for future reference. The project itself in my use case was made for reintroducing myself to Java.
### What are things that could have been better?
Well mainly an waiting system within the loading bar in the for loop. And possibly splitting segments into their own classes to make the system more abstract and less lengthy.
